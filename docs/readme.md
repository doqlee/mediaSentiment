### Sentiment Indicators

1. **Country-specific news sentiment** (`sentiment_country`):  
   - Available: 1991–2019  
   - Generated by: `./code/1 sentiment country.do`

2. **Local news sentiment** (`sentiment_local`):  
   - Available: 1991–2015  
   - Generated by: `./code/2 sentiment local.do`

3. **Global news sentiment** (`sentiment_global`):

### Methodology

- **Data source**: Factiva.com (Reuters articles, 1991–2019)  
- **Filtering criteria**:
  - English-language articles  
  - Tagged as *economic news* or *financial market news*  
  - Tagged with one of the 25 sample countries (9 advanced economies, 16 emerging markets)

#### Sentiment Construction

- **Bag-of-words approach**:
  - Combines dictionaries from *Loughran and McDonald (2011)* and *Young and Soroka (2012)*.
  - Expanded with word inflections (e.g., *lose*, *losing*, *lost*).
  - Final dictionaries: 7,217 negative words, 3,250 positive words.

- **Sentiment score**:  
  - Difference between the share of positive and negative words in an article.  
  - Weighted by word frequency.  

- **Aggregation**:  
  - Daily average sentiment per country.  
  - Standardized as z-scores (relative to each country’s mean and standard deviation).
